#summary The Steps of how IPMsg transports files(not folder)

<pre class=prettyprint>
The following steps show how IPMsg transports files(not folder):

Step 1: Sender send a UDP package to tell the receiver that it want
	to send some files. The data of the UDP package is formated as:

	UDP_DATA = "version:myPackageNumber:userName:hostName:command:"
		+ 'NUL' + FILE_INFO + 'NUL';
	FILE_INFO = FILE1_INFO + 'BEL' + FILE2_INFO + 'BEL' + ...
	FILEn_INFO = "fileNumber:fileName:fileSize:fileLastModifyTime:1:"

	Note: fileSize, fileLastModifyTime are hex format.

Step 2: If the receiver accept one of the files, it will build a TCP 
	connection to the sender with port 2425.

Step 3: After the TCP connection was built, the receiver send a TCP package 
	to the sender. The data of the TCP package is formated as:

	TCP_DATA = "version:myPackageNumber:userName:hostName:command:"
		+ "senderPackageNumber:fileNumber:offset:"

	Note: senderPackageNumber, fileNumber, offset are hex format.

Step 4: Now the sender know that the receiver want which file(it got
	the senderPackageNumber & file Number from step 3). So, it 
	put the file content into a TCP package and send it to the 
	receiver.

Step 5: The TCP connection was disconnected.

Step 6: If the receiver want to get the other files, repeat step 2 to 6.
